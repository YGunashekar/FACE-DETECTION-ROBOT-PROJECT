# ACADAMIC-PROJECT 1

## 🤖 Face Detection Robot using OpenCV and Python

### 📌 Overview
This project is a **real-time face detection system** that can be integrated into a robot using a camera feed. It utilizes **OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifiers** to detect human faces and can be enhanced to trigger robot responses upon detection (e.g., movement, alerts).

### 🎯 Features
- Real-time face detection using a webcam or camera module
- Highlight detected faces with bounding boxes
- Can be extended for **face tracking**, **expression recognition**, or **robotic response**

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Haarcascade Frontal Face Classifier

### 🚀 How It Works
1. The webcam continuously captures video frames.
2. Each frame is converted to grayscale (as face detection works better in monochrome).
3. The Haar cascade classifier scans for patterns resembling a human face.
4. If faces are found, rectangles are drawn on the video stream.
5. MY BAD I LOST ALL THESE PROJECT FILES BUT I WAS OFFICILLY DONE IN COLLEGE .

### 📦 Dependencies
Install OpenCV using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
